# Getting started with React app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This repository contains a React website built using modern web development techniques. It serves as a basic template for creating web applications using React and can be easily customized to fit specific project requirements.

# Available Scripts

```
npm start
